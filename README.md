# Numpy for ML Equations

A practical guide to numpy operations tailored for learning machine learning. This is not a basic numpy introduction but focuses on common operations and patterns to help translate mathematical equations into Python code. It highlights potential pitfalls and common mistakes that can confuse learners.

## Overview

This repository is designed to help learners:

- Understand how numpy operations relate to mathematical equations.
- Gain confidence in implementing machine learning equations in Python.
- Avoid common mistakes, such as confusion between dot product, elementwise operations, and array transpositions.

The content is organized with step-by-step explanations and examples to ensure clarity.

## Features

- Practical explanations of key numpy operations, such as:
  - Dot product
  - Elementwise multiplication
  - Transposing arrays
  - Reshaping arrays
  - Outer product
- Debugging tips for handling array shapes.
- Examples of translating mathematical equations into Python code.

## Who Is This For?

This guide is for:

- Beginners in machine learning who are familiar with Python and want to strengthen their numpy skills.
- Anyone struggling to implement mathematical equations in Python using numpy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running interactive examples)

## Topics Covered

- Translating equations into numpy code.
- Understanding shapes and dimensions.
- When and how to use transpose operations.
- Avoiding common errors in numpy multiplication.

## Example Content

- **Dot Product Example:**
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  
  theta = np.array([1, 2])
  x = np.array([3, 4])
  result = np.dot(theta, x)
  print(result)  # Output: 11
  ```

- **Shape Debugging Tip:**
  ```python
  array = np.array([[1, 2]])
  print(array.shape)  # Output: (1, 2)
  ```
